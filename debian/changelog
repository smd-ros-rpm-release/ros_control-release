ros-hydro-controller-manager (0.5.8-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * Fixed additional timeout that was just added
  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' into extended_wait_time
  * Extended wait time to 30 seconds for slower computers
  * Renamed manifest.xml to prevent conflicts with rosdep
  * Fix broken unspawner script.
  * Check controller_manager API early. Fast shutdown.
    - Check for all services required by spawner at the beginning, so it can know
    early on that it has all its requisites.
    - Remove service waiting from shutdown to ensure a fast teardown.
    Usecase: A spawner that dies after the controller manager should not wait
    for services to appear as they will never appear, the controllers are already
    stopped. This happens for example when killing a Gazebo session.
  * Restore controller stop+unload on node kill.
    - Fixes #111 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros_control/issues/111>.

ros-hydro-controller-manager (0.5.7-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * Update controller_manager.cpp
    getControllerNames now clears names before adding current names.  This fixes a bug in reloadControllerLibrariesSrv where the method is called twice in a row without first clearing the list.
    Steps to reproduce:
    - Spawn controller
    - Stop controller
    - reload-libraries
    controller_manager.cpp:501: bool controller_manager::ControllerManager::reloadControllerLibrariesSrv(controller_manager_msgs::ReloadControllerLibraries::Request&, controller_manager_msgs::ReloadControllerLibraries::Response&): Assertion `controllers.empty()' failed.
  * Updated changelogs
